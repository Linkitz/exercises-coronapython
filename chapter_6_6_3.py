# 6-3. Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

#• Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.

#• Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.

programming_words ={'if':'whether verification', 'else':'otherwise do something', 'for':'an intentional loop with some condition','and':'true when all conditions are true', 'or':'When one or another or both conditions are true or operation return true.'}

print("if: " + programming_words['if'])
print("else: " + programming_words['else'])
print("for: " + programming_words['for'])
print("and: " + programming_words['and'])
print("or: " + programming_words['or'])
