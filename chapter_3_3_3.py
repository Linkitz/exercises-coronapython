# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

transport=['Ferrari', 'Mazda','Porsche']

print("I would like to own a " + transport[0] + " Car.")
print("I would like to own a " + transport[1] + " Car.")
print("I would like to own a " + transport[2] + " Car.")
