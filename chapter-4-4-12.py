# 4-12. More Loops: All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using for loops when printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and write two for loops to print each list of foods.

# First foods.py
my_pizzas = ["Calabresa","Four Cheese","Atum"]
friend_pizzas = ["chocolate","Banana","Margherita"]

print("My favorite pizzas are: ")
for pizza in my_pizzas:
    print(pizza)

print("My friendâ€™s favorite pizzas are: ")
for pizza in friend_pizzas:
