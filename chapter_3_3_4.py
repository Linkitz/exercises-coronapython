# 3-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

strangeperson = ['Strange Nº 1', 'Strange Nº 2', 'Strange Nº 3']

print("Yoooo! " + strangeperson[0] + ", let's dinner!")
print("Yoooo! " + strangeperson[1] + ", let's dinner!")
print("Yoooo! " + strangeperson[2] + ", let's dinner!")
