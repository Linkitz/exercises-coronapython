# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

while True:
    message = input("Type your age for ticket price check.")
    if (message == 'quit'):
        break
    message = int(message)
    if (message < 3):
        print("Your ticket is free!")
    elif (message >= 3) and (message < 12):
        print("Your ticket cost $10!")
    elif (message >= 12):
        print("Your ticket cost $15!")
