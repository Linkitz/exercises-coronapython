# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ['Andre', 'Matheus', 'Thales']
message = "One of my best friends is "

print(message + names[0])
print(message + names[1])
print(message + names[2])
