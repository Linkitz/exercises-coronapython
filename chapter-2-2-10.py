# 2-10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


#This exercices shows my favorite number.
number = 21
print("My favorite number is " + str(number) + ".")

#This one my favorite sentence.
name = "Thrall"

print(name + " once said \"The beginning of wisdom is the statement ’I do not know.’ The person who cannot make that statement is one who will never learn anything...\"")
